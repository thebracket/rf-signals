# RF_Signals

This is a Rust wrapper for [Cloud-RF/Signal Server](https://github.com/Cloud-RF/Signal-Server) algorithms. In turn, this is based upon SPLAT! by Alex Farrant and John A. Magliacane.

I've retained the GPL2 license, because the parent requires it. I needed this for work, I'm hoping someone finds it useful.
