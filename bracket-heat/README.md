# Bracket-Heat

An in-development RF heat-mapping system.

## Requirements

* This requires nightly Rust, because of Rocket. ```rustup override set nightly``` should do the trick.
* You need to put your Google Maps API key in `bracket-heat/resources/gmap_key.txt`. One line without a `\n` at the end. I didn't want to share my Google account details with you. Sorry.
